# 🚧 MediaX — Vision & Roadmap

> ⚠️ **MediaX** is currently in **active private development**.  
> This public repository serves as a hub for sharing the high-level **vision, roadmap, and community discussions**.  
> It’s designed to gather feedback, ideas, and explore potential funding opportunities while keeping core development secure and internal.  
> The actual codebase for MediaX (core pipeline) and the Gallery (user-facing UI) are maintained in private repositories.

## ✨ What is MediaX?

MediaX is envisioned as a **modular, zero-knowledge, privacy-first media management pipeline**—built for individuals and teams who demand control over their digital assets.

Key pillars include:
- 🔐 **Zero-Knowledge Encryption & Secure Backups**: End-to-end privacy with encrypted storage and recovery options that ensure only you hold the keys.
- 🧩 **Modular AI Integrations**: Tools for deduplication, OCR, NSFW filtering, automated tagging, and semantic search—plug-and-play for customization.
- 🛡 **Resilient Storage Solutions**: Self-healing parity checks, write-once-read-many (WORM) modes, and escrow-based recovery for long-term data integrity.
- 🌌 **Future-Proof Architecture**: Offline-first and local-first design, with cross-platform compatibility to adapt to evolving tech landscapes.
- ⚡ **Performance-Optimized**: Leveraging Rust for efficiency, GPU acceleration for heavy tasks, and asynchronous pipelines for seamless workflows.

At its heart, MediaX is the **foundational backend**—a robust engine for media processing, not a standalone app. It's designed to power applications like galleries, archives, or custom tools.

## 🖼️ The Gallery Project

The Gallery is a **companion project** focused on the user experience:
- 🖥️ **Intuitive Interfaces**: Desktop and web-based UIs for browsing, organizing, and interacting with media.
- 🔍 **Advanced Search & Filtering**: Powered by MediaX's AI modules for smart queries and recommendations.
- 🎨 **Editing & Enhancement Tools**: Tag suggestions, previews, and basic edits to streamline workflows.
- 📊 **Monitoring Dashboards**: Insights into storage health, usage stats, and system performance.

Like MediaX, the Gallery is developed in a separate private repository with its own iterative roadmap. It relies on MediaX as its core backend but can evolve independently.

## 🚀 Current Status & Roadmap

- **MediaX Core**: In early internal development with over 3,000 commits across private repos. Modules are being prototyped and tested for stability.
- **Gallery UI/UX**: Experimental designs and prototypes in progress, focusing on user-centric features.
- **Public Releases**: Code will be open-sourced in phased stages as components mature—starting with non-core utilities or documentation.
- **Milestones Ahead**:
  - Q4 2025: Stabilize core encryption and AI modules.
  - Q1 2026: Internal beta for Gallery integration.
  - Ongoing: Community-driven refinements based on feedback here.

This public repo is intentionally lightweight to foster open collaboration without exposing sensitive IP.
