## ✨ Vision

The goal of this project is to build a **next-generation media toolkit**:

- 🔐 **Zero-knowledge privacy** — no one but you sees your data.
- 🧩 **Modular design** — each feature (tagging, backup, deduplication, AI) can stand alone.
- 🛡 **Resilient storage** — parity, self-healing, and offline safety layers.
- 🌌 **Future-proof search** — semantic, memory-aware, human-friendly discovery.
- ⚡ **Cross-platform** — runs locally on Linux, Windows, and macOS with GPU acceleration where available.

This isn’t just “another gallery app.”  
It’s meant to be **trustworthy infrastructure** for personal and professional archives.

## 🚀 Current Status

- 🔨 Early architecture work is happening in **private repos**.  
- 📊 Over **3,000 commits** have already been made in private development.  
- 📖 This public repo exists as a **blueprint & community board** — code will be published in stages once core parts stabilize.

## 💡 Open for Suggestions

This is the right time to shape the project.  
We are open to ideas on:

- Better **project name** (MediaX is temporary).  
- Feature priorities (what’s most valuable first: backup, dedup, AI tagging, UI?).  
- Integration ideas (cloud overlays, local-only strongholds, web vs desktop clients).  
- UI/UX proposals (privacy-first by design).
